/**
 * Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.
 *
 * As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
 *
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
 * Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: root = [0,null,1]
 * Output: [1,null,1]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 100
 * All the values in the tree are unique.
